      See, these gems have innate magical properties. By linking circles together, the gems' magic can be stabalized and utilized for our own desires. Really precise stuff, but you don't have to worry about that. Sorcerers far smarter than you and me have already figured this stuff out.

      Now, give it a go. Click on a gem bring out it's magic. Then, click on another circle to connect the gems. If the circuit connects exactly 4 circles, it succeeds! Otherwise it'll dissipate.
